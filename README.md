some simple tauri app, to calculate CMSA and RCA(soon)
(the calculation is all done in javascript (not recommended :: find alternatives))
just zip it, then npm install  
and go to the directory where you unzipped it

    and type in cmd/powershell
        npm run tauri dev
    to build
        npm run tauri build

there are so many th9ings that need to be reconsidered

such as

1. the menu before calculating cmsa
   a. option to choose year is still buggy
   need to be fixed although not on the top list of priority
   b. add some input to indicate the world data
