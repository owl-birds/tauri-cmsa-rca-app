some simple tauri app, to calculate CMSA and RCA(soon)
(the calculation is all done in javascript (not recommended :: find alternatives))
just zip it, then npm install  
and go to the directory where you unzipped it

    and type in cmd/powershell
        npm run tauri dev
    to build
        npm run tauri build
